Hey there!  I'm Rudy, and I enjoy using technology to understand biology.

While technology has long been an interest and hobby of mine, the idea of using it to solve problems in biology was a draw to me which I couldn't pass up.

As I believe that computational modeling is invaluable to neuroscientific research, I am as passionate about the programming as I am about the science.  Therefore I enjoy writing software that is in the realm of computational neuroscience.

This software has been my focus for about a year now, but I have also been writing scripts, websites, and other closely-related works for general use and fun for over three years.

I primarily use R and Javascript as my core programming languages, but often incorporate other languages and tools within my work.

My coding skills are almost entirely self-taught.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Biology at Saint Louis University, where I concentrated in cell biology and neuroscience. After finishing, I have continued to pursue my work and have been coding and modeling neurological systems ever since.

      Hey there!  I'm Rudy, and I enjoy applying technology to neuroscience.<br><br>
      
      What this means is that I build software simulations and models of neural networks.  This is useful because such simulations can aide in scientific research.  For example, if you want to know how long memory lasts then modeling can help you answer this question.<br><br>
      
      Some examples of what I have done can be found in my <a href="3_work.html">portfolio</a>.<br><br>
